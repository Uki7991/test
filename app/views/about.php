            <p>Welcome!</p>
            <p>
                My name is Tilek and this is my project, it is made by pain and ocean of emotions. Because of Laravel. I don`t know
                native PHP but on all challenges I don`t give up and go forward to new emotions :)
            </p>
            <p>
                I do other projects on Laravel and create something on this framework is pleasure.
                This framework I started to learn when I studied on 2 course 1-st semester.
                Then I met web server, on Windows OpenServer helped me, it is easy to configure web apps on Windows.
            </p>
            <p>
                I recently switched to the *unix system (Ububtu) on my laptop and then I met a challenge like terminal.
            </p>
            <p>
                I spend one week to abstract in this OS, played with the same terminal, installed apache, php, mysql.
                It was hard week but now I know what should I do when it necessary on projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                And I know Bootstrap4 front-end framework, jQuery. I worked with technologies like AJAX.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have mini portfolio: <a href="http://albatroshotel.kg" target="_blank">albatroshotel.kg</a>,

                About my education. I switched my full-time education to part-time at 1.5 years after I entered, so I go to university only for one month in semester.
                In 1-st semester on April, in 2-nd - November.
            </p>
            <p>
                That is all what I want to say about me :)
            </p>
            <p>
                With regards, Tilek.
